# Level Control Process Rig

##Overview:
Industrial processes are at the heart of manufacturing almost all products throughout the world. At the heart of these production plants is process control, an area mistaken as a dark art to many. This library and its associated hardware (see below) have been created to give those with limited resource access to a simple industrial rig that can be used for experimentation with a variety of different control algortithms. Due to the scale of this project, many real world industrial problems that still exist are amplified. A list of these can be ffound within the documentation.

##Project Aims:
* Provide a basic flow control process
* Introduce MODBUS
* Introduce common control system ideas & terminology
* Provide a rig to which control algoritms can be applied

##Requirements
###Hardware:
The functionality of this repository is based upon the user building the hardware described within the project documents. It is a simple build process that is documented in a way that should be easy to follow, with full parts list and accompanied drawings. For those with no experience in control or electronics, following the instructions to the letter is recommended. It is noted however that this project can be expanded dramatically or a minor amount of funcationality cut if necessary.
